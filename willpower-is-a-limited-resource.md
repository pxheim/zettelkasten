Willpower is kinda like a muscle. You can use it for a while, but eventually you'll get tired and need to rest. You can train it somewhat, but in general it's a limited resource and thus instead of trying to squeeze more out of it, it's better to [change-the-environment-to-preserve-willpower](change-the-environment-to-preserve-willpower.md).
