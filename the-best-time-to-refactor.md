The best time to refactor is before you add a new feature or before you fix a bug. This is often called preparatory refactoring. You often see a better way of adding something that can be done by refactoring, so you should.

Comprehension refactoring is similar, but is done for you to understand better what the code does, most likely before adding something new.
