Training your designer first starts at the organization level. If your org. is not willing to change, or to accept the fact that some changes reduce productivity in the short term before it increases in the long term, this might not work for you.

Your team will benefit from closer collaboration between designers and developers as they work in the same way, but have different perspectives on things.

Developers are tech focused whereas designers are user focused.

> Developers are focused on working in their own little bubble whereas designers have direct contact with users and user-data. Would be nice to find a way to shift this. Acceptance tests?
