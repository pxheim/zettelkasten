Use the calendar to remind you to check in on projects at a later day. It's a useful way to make sure you check in on things you delay. It's also useful to set up reminders for yourself for actions you defer due to internal factors, e.g. "I need to sleep on this before making a decision".

Remember that the calendar should, however, never contain actions that do not need to be done on a specific day. Reminders are not actions, but there's a fine line between them.
