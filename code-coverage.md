Code coverage is the amount of your code that is covered by tests.

What is ideal code coverage is somewhat of a debated topic. [[book-humble-farley-2010-continuous-delivery]] suggests that something around 80% is sufficient. [[book-martin-2021-clean-craftsmanship]] claims that you should never accept anything other than 100%, while also stating that you're likely never able to achieve 100% coverage for your entire application, but you should work towards it by creating meaningful tests nonetheless.

Never turn code coverage into a management metric. Business people often do not understand the concept around code coverage and can get too caught up in the number.

Never fail the build if coverage is low.
