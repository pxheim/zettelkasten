The five dysfunctions of a team are represented as a pyramid where the bottommost dysfunction leads to the upper layers. From the top, they are:
- [[dysfunction-lack-of-trust]]
- [[dysfunction-fear-of-conflict]]
- 


- Inattention to results: status and ego. Your team goals are the most important, not your own. And your team should share the same goals. It's not sales' responsibility that sales are down. It's the whole fucking team.
- Avoidance of accountability: low standards. If you don't commit, you also cannot be held accountable. After all, you didn't agree with whatever was decided anyway as you didn't get to offload your thoughts. This leads to low standards. You should hold your peers accountable, not just the people that report to you. This means, that all leaders, as peers, should hold each other accountable.
- Lack of commitment: ambiguity. If you're not able offload your opinions, you are less likely to buy-in to commitments that are made (as you feel like you were unable to contribute), thus leading to ambiguity.

Politics is when your actions reflect the reaction you want from others vs. what you believe yourself.

Conflict is good. Every good movie includes some for of conflict, otherwise it would be boring. Consider movies and meetings to be similar. For a meeting to be good, it also needs to include some form of conflict. A healthy one at that. 

A team cannot function when one person in the team does not want to be a team player. This affects the performance of the rest of the team. Ultimately it might be better to relieve the team of the people that are not working as a team, to ensure that the others are not leaving.
