Rather than following rigid maturity model levels, organizations should focus on developing specific capabilities tied to desired outcomes. This approach better accounts for the ever-changing nature of software development and allows teams to focus on capabilities that provide immediate value.

Each capability should be:
1. Tied to specific outcomes
2. Chosen based on current needs
3. Implemented incrementally
4. Measured against desired results

The focus on capabilities over maturity levels enables organizations to adapt to changing requirements and technology landscapes more effectively.
