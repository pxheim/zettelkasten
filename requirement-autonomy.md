Teams should have the autonomy to modify requirements without external approval, provided they follow good development practices. This autonomy must be balanced with responsibility and proper development practices.

Implementation guidelines:
1. Teams empowered to adjust requirements
2. Good development practices must be in place
3. Regular communication with stakeholders
4. Clear documentation of changes
5. Measurement of impact

Key benefits:
- Faster response to changing needs
- Increased team ownership
- Better alignment with user needs
- Reduced bureaucratic overhead
