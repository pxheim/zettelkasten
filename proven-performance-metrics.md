Four key metrics have been proven to effectively measure software delivery performance:

1. Delivery lead time: Time from feature request to completion
2. Deployment frequency: Rate of production deployments
3. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR): Average recovery time from system failures
4. Change fail rate: Percentage of changes causing failures

These metrics cover both performance (lead time, deployment frequency) and stability (MTTR, change fail rate) aspects of delivery.
