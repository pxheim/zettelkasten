When defining next actions, projects with multiple moving components should have an action assigned to each as long as they do not depend on each other or other component's next actions. A next action can be to plan your next actions. This is fine. You need to plan enough to get your mind to relax, i.e. get it out of your head. If you're still thinking about something after you have planned it, you most likely did not plan it well enough.
