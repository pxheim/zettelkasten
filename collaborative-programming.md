Collaborative programming, often called pair programming, is the act of two programmers working together on a single computer. Contrary to popular belief, it does not make the productivity drop by 50%. Instead, studies have shown that it does drop, but only by about 15%. However, at the same time, 15% less bugs are introduced, and 15% less code is needed per feature, so overall it's a win.

When putting together pair programming teams, consider the seniority of the people who ar programming togeher:

- Senior + Junior = Good
- Senior + Senior = Good
- Junior + Junior = Warning. Should be watched by senior.
