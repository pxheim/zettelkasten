The natural planning model is the way our brains naturally want to plan things, and it's the best way to approach GTD. It consist of going through the steps:

1. Purpose - The first part of the natural planning model is to define a purpose. The "why" we are wanting to do something in the first place. After defining this we can know when we've succeeded, it creates a decision making criteria, aligns resources, motivates, clarifies focus and expands options.
2. Principles - The principles of the natural planning model defines how we want things to be done. Not literally "how", but how something should be done while also aligning with our values. An efficient team really has these principles down pat.
3. Vision - When planning, one of the most important things to do is defining what success will look like, i.e. what is a successful outcome. This should ideally allow us to stay focused on meeting this outcome. However, when planning, [[do-not-estimate-time-based-on-outcome]].
4. Brainstorming - Brainstorming as part of the natural planning process can be beneficial to figure out how to get to where we want to, i.e. if you have a purpose defined, and you know the outcome, you need to brainstorm to figure out how to get there through your values. When brainstorming like this, refrain from analyzing and organizing. You're just making a list for the sole purpose of offloading your brain through [[distributed-cognition]].
5. Organizing - Organizing roughly follows three steps: first Identify the important bits, then sort the stuff by some criteria, e.g. priority and then detail out what needs to be done.
6. Action - Do the things!

[[ahrens-2022-how-to-take-smart-notes]] advocates that [[brainstorming-is-terrible]] as the only place you can draw on for information when brainstorming is your own head.

The opposite of the natural planning model is [[the-reactive-planning-model]], which is the natural planning model in reverse.
