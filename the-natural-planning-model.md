The natural planning model is the way our brains naturally want to plan things, and it's the best way to approach GTD. It consist of going through the steps:

1. purpose
2. principles
3. vision
4. brainstorming
5. organizing
6. action

The opposite of the natural planning model is the reactive planning model, which is the natural planning model in reverse.
