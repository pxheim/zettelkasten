The natural planning model is the way our brains naturally want to plan things, and it's the best way to approach GTD. It consist of going through the steps:

1. 

1. purpose - [[purpose-of-the-natural-planning-model]]
2. principles - [[principles-of-the-natural-planning-model]]
3. vision - [[vision-of-the-natural-planning-model]]
4. brainstorming - [[brainstorming-in-the-natural-planning-model]]
5. organizing - [[organizing-in-the-natural-planning-model]]
6. action

The opposite of the natural planning model is [[the-reactive-planning-model]], which is the natural planning model in reverse.
