The natural planning model is the way our brains naturally want to plan things, and it's the best way to approach GTD. It consist of going through the steps:

1. purpose - [purpose-of-the-natural-planning-model](purpose-of-the-natural-planning-model.md)
2. principles - [principles-of-the-natural-planning-model](principles-of-the-natural-planning-model.md)
3. vision - [vision-of-the-natural-planning-model](vision-of-the-natural-planning-model.md)
4. brainstorming - 
5. organizing
6. action

The opposite of the natural planning model is the reactive planning model, which is the natural planning model in reverse.
