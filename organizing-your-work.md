The core concept of organizing "stuff" is to put that stuff into categories that mean the same as the stuff does to you. E.g. if you decide that something is a reference and you put it where your references go, you've organized  it. The difficult thing, however, is to figure out what exactly something means to you. 

When [[working-with-next-actions]], there are 7 main categories to them in:

- Projects [[projects--stuff-with-multiple-actions]]
- Project support material: [[project-support-material]]
- Calendar actions: [[use-calendar-for-time-and-date-sensitive-actions]]
- Next lists: [[sorting-next-actions-into-lists]]
- Waiting-for lists: [[waiting-for-lists]]
- Reference material: [[working-with-notes-set-zettelkasten-apart]]
- Someday / Maybe list: [[someday-maybe-lists-for-the-future]]
