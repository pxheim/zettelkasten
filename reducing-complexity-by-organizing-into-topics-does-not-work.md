It may be tempting to try to organize notes and other things into categories and sub categories. Initially this may looks neat and structured, but this only works to a certain extend as the complexity of the structure increases with the amount of content. Additionally, the content stored will only be related to similar things, thus disabling the ability to create connections between different contexts.

When you evidently add more notes to a topic, it eventually becomes hard to sort through your notes. When you then try to add another subdivision to your notes, you just move the mess one level down.
