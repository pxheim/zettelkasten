There are three main types of team interaction:
- **Collaboration**: working together closely for a defined period of time to discover new things.
- **X-as-a-service (XaaS)**: one team provides something and the other team consumes it.
- **Facilitating**: one team helps and mentors another team.

Collaboration is best suited for teams working on something new together. Discovering new ways of doing stuff together can be valuable. Keep in mind that Dunbar's number still applies when two teams join together through collaboration. Before joining, establish clear boundaries, otherwise ownership, responsibility and trust might degrade. Mutual respect and high interaction is paramount.

XaaS works best in later stages of software development when reliability and stability is needed more than innovative new approaches. Teams providing XaaS will need to figure out how their services i used and how. With this pattern, UX and DevEx is very important.

Facilitating teams work across many teams, helping them overcome obstacles, improve workflow or get into better procedures. Typically this is an enabling team that focuses on helping, but also being helped.
