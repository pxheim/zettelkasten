Be comfortable about _not_ doing something. If you have defined all the things in your life and next actions associated with them, and you know you are working on the most important one of those things because you organized and prioritized everything, you can feel fine _not_ doing something. Very useful when dealing with interrupting tasks - you can feel comfortable saying no to something, or you can consciously choose to do something other than what you are doing now.
