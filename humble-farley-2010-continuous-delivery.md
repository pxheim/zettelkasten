The Deployment Pipeline is the process that takes your application from built to deploy to test to release. Will vary greatly from company to company or even app to app.

Two main components of delivering high quality software is automation and frequent releases. Automated because otherwise each release can be different and frequent in order to mitigate risk, but also get feedback often.

3 key components to good feedback from releases:
1. Every change should provide feedback.
2. Should get feedback as soon as possible.
3. Feedback must be acted upon.

Feedback most often come in the form of test results.
