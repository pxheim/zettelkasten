Devops three ways:

The first way: company should emphasize performance of the whole system vs just focusing on parts of it. The whole of an organization needs to work towards it's goals, not just parts of it. 

The second way: Feedback loops from left to right (i.e. backwards) must be amplified and made visible. Fixes can then be made quickly and issues can be reacted upon.

The third way: Take risks and experiment, and learn from failure.
