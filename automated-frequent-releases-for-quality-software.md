Two main components of delivering high quality software is automation and frequent releases. 

Automation of the release is required to ensure that the releases are done the same way consistently. This removes all forms of issues related to the release.

Frequent releases is needed in order to get feedback often on the changes implemented. Feedback most often come in the form of tests, but can also be metrics gathered while the application goes through the deployment pipeline. When feedback is considered:
1. Every change should provide feedback.
2. Feedback should be provided as soon as possible.
3. Feedback must be acted upon.
