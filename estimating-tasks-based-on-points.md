Estimating tasks is hard, especially if you are asked to estimate a task based on time. A better approach would be to estimate sometime in relation to some other task, and use arbitrary points to do so, often called "story points".

For example, when estimating tasks that are part of a user story, you might know that, on a scale from 0 (easy) to 10 (hard), your gut feeling will tell you that it's a 4. This becomes your reference task, and all other tasks are to be estimated in relation to this task. If it's easier than the reference task, it's given a lower point value, if harder, a higher point value.

You do not know how long it's going to take, but over time you will establish how many of these arbitrary points your team is going to be able to handle in a single iteration, thus your development becomes more reliable.
