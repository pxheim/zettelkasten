Dedicated time for experimentation (approximately 20% of work time) should be allocated for innovation and learning. This includes post-release experimentation and scheduled time for specific improvement activities.

Implementation guidelines:
1. Set aside ~20% of work time for experimentation
2. Allow post-release exploration
3. Create safe spaces for failure
4. Encourage innovative thinking
5. Measure and learn from experiments
