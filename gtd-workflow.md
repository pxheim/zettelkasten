GTD can be broken down into three main parts, but 5 total parts:
(1) capture everything that needs to be done in a system that frees your brain, (2) decide selectively on which things you allow to be tackled, and thus always know what the next thing to focus on is, and (3) organize and maintain all the things you need to get done.

Optimal workflow for GTD is a 5-step process where you

1. **Capture**: Get everything out of your head: [[efficiently-capturing-things-on-your-mind]]
2. **Clarify**: Define a next-action everything: [[working-with-next-actions]]
3. **Organize**: Make a reminder for the things. [[7-main-ways-next-actions-can-be-organized]]
4. **Reflect**: Keep your things up to date.
5. **Engage**: Do the right next-action.
