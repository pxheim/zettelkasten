The brain has a tendency to jump to conclusions based on what it things we want to figure out, which is not necessarily what we actually want. Getting things down on paper to think about it will offload the brain and then you'll be able to think more clearly about things. It's like you make some distance between your problem and the brain, allowing you to view it from different angles.

You don't think and then write it down, you think _with_ the paper. It's a tool to facilitate thinking.
