Teams should have the freedom to:

1. Select appropriate tools for their tasks
2. Modify requirements based on technical insights
3. Make technical decisions within their domain
4. Choose their learning and development paths
5. Experiment with new approaches

This autonomy must be balanced with responsibility and good development practices. Teams with higher autonomy typically show better performance and higher job satisfaction.
