Friction is what's preventing you from achieving your plan. There are three gaps that are amplified by friction:

- Knowledge gap: difference between what we know and what we'd like to know.
- Alignment gap: difference between what we'd like people to do and what they actually do.
- Effects gap: difference between what we expect our actions to achieve vs. what they actually acieve.

To resolve the gaps, we often do the opposite of what would solve it:

- Knowledge gap: we don't have enough info so we plan more. Cannot plan w/o knowledge, so we act on what we believe we know.
- Alignment gap: we issue more instructions.
- Effects gap: we tighten control of people's autonomy. E.g. CS person that must go through step-by-step troubleshooting.
Start with what you do know and figure out what you don't know.

Working in the complex domain, more is unknown vs what is known. In the complicated domain, more is known, thus expercs can plan for that needs to be done. Dangerous to think you are in the complicated domain when you are not, in which case you make plans that only act as noise. Make humble (small) plans instead & discover.

Don't tell people what to do, tell people what you intend to do, then let them find the best way to do it. Lead with intent.

The product backlog should have a product goal, similar to how the sprint backlog has a sprint goal. The product goal drives the creation of the sprint goal.

Setting a goal separates intent from the plan. When we learn more after starting the sprint, we can adjust the plan to still meet the intent.

---

If you don't have a sprint goal, the focus of the sprint will be on the **output**, not the **outcome**.
