A module's stability can be viewed as the relationship between volatility and strength, i.e. how often a module is expected to change and how tightly coupled it is.

| Volatility / Strength | High                                                            | Low                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| High                  | Stable                                                          | Component changes often, but is not coupled. This is good. |
| Low                   | Component changes rarely, but is tightly coupled. This is good. | Unstable                                                   |
