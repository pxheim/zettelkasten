Products & services are not inherently valuable, so focusing on how many of them you create or provide to your customer is not good if you seek to create value. You're measuring your output, which is often very easy, when you should be measuring the outcomes which often involve talking to customers to measure how whatever you made was perceived.

When company measures output vs outcomes, it's often referred to as "the build trap", i.e. they are just building for the sake of building.
