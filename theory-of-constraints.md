If wanting to optimize a process, it's important to identify the bottleneck first, and then optimize there. There's no point in optimizing anything before the bottleneck as that'll just make things pile up before it, and optimizing after it will just make people have less to do. This is called the Theory of Constraints.

The process outlines 5 steps for improving any process:
1. Identify the constraint.
2. Exploit the constraint, i.e. set them up for success.
3. Subordinate others, i.e. force others to help out wherever possible.
4. Elevate the constraint, i.e. hire more people, add more compute power, etc.
5. Start from 1 again.
