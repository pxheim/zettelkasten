If wanting to optimize a process, it's important to identify the bottleneck first, and then optimize there. There's no point in optimizing anything before the bottleneck as that'll just make things pile up before it, and optimizing after it will just make people have less to do. This is called the Theory of Constraints.

The theory outlines three tools that can aid in optimizing this process:

The five focusing steps:
1. Identify the constraint.
2. Exploit the constraint: set them up for success, using current resources.
3. Subordinate others: align other parts of your process to set the constraint up for success.
4. Elevate the constraint: if 2 and 3 does not help moving the constraint some, consider what else can be done to eliminate the constraint, e.g. hire more people, add more compute power, etc.
5. Start from 1 again.

The thinking process:
