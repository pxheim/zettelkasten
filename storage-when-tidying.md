Keep your storage solution as simple as possible; no fancy solutions. These often hide what you actually have and get in the way of getting an overview. Transparent boxes stacked on top of one another in a neat system still contains tons of items that you might not know you have. They are, however, great, but keep them to a minimum, avoid stacking and piling them.

Best storage container is a rectangular shoebox. Avoid other shapes.

Storage should be focused on making it easy to put something away, not getting something out. If it's easy to put away, you are more likely to do so, reducing clutter.

Store similar things together, don't store by frequency of use. The location where you store the items will sort out sorting by frequency of use by itself.
