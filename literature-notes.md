Turning a [[reference-notes]] (or multiple) into something you write with your own words make it a literature note. This makes you think about what the note means and ensures you understand what you have written down. Not all reference notes need to be turned into literature notes.

Good literature notes should contain the gist of an idea in your own words.

Make sure to include page number(s) or chapter number(s) for the references that make up the literature note so that you can refer to them later.

Making literature notes forces you to [[elaboration-best-way-to-learn.md|elaborate]] on what you have written, facilitating learning.

When working with the literature notes, do not just consider what is there, also make it a habit to ask what is not in the picture that could be relevant. This helps you connect the note to other contexts, and also elaborate on them.
