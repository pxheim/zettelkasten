The last dysfunction is when the team puts individual results above those of the team. This can be anything from valuing their own career progression more than the results of the team to simply saving face.





Inattention to results: status and ego. Your team goals are the most important, not your own. And your team should share the same goals. It's not sales' responsibility that sales are down. It's the whole fucking team.
