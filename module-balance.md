A module's balance can be defined as

(STRENGTH XOR DISTANCE) OR NOT VOLATILITY

This means that given strength, distance and volatility, there are two combinations of these can would cause the balance of a module to be considered low:

- Low strength, low distance, high volatility: This is locally complex component that needs to change often. This is not good.
- High strength, high distance, high volatility: This is a globally complex component that needs to change often. This is not good.

Essentially if a locally or globally complex component changes often, it's not balanced. The other coupling variations always have something that will offset the imbalance, leading to a balanced component.
