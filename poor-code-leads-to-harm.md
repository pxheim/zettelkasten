You are responsible for the code that you write and what it does. If you write code, you are to blame if something goes wrong. You cannot blame upper management for giving you requirements.

It's often hard to know whether your software can cause harm or not. Thus, you must know exactly what your code can and cannot do. There's almost always more risk than you think. Messy software is harmful software, keep it clean, functional and tested. Do not leave crap around in your code. Quick fixes and workarounds must be removed or fixed, not left.

Doing [[test-driven-development]] will prevent these potential harmful issues.
