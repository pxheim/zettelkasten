Changes to software can be split into either tactical or strategic.

Tactical changes change the "how" things are done in the code. These changes revolve around fixing bugs and making changes to existing modules. They are most often safe to implement without too much consideration as they don't affect the interplay between modules.

Strategic changes change "what" things are done, and often involve adding new modules or designing entirely new features. These need to be added with great care as they can rock the foundations of your design.
