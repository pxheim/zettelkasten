The second dysfunction is fear of conflict which creates artificial harmony within a team. Conflict is needed and it's healthy, not just in business, but also in other aspects of life in general. Getting into efficient conflicts you are able to hash out issues quickly.

Conflict is good. Every good movie includes some for of conflict, otherwise it would be boring. Consider movies and meetings to be similar. For a meeting to be good, it also needs to include some form of conflict. A healthy one at that.

In order to assist with conflicts you can
- Miner: delegate the role of conflict miner to a member of the team. They are responsible for finding conflicts that may be hidden and getting them out in the open to be hashed out.
- Reminder: During a conflict, you might have people check out, or in another way no longer engage in the conflict. They might even be unsure that they are taking things too far. When this happens, remind everyone that conflict is good, and it needs to be done. At the end of such an encounter ensure that this is restated.

As a leader you must resist the urge to protect your team members when conflict arises. Just like a child needs to learn conflict resolution skills, so do your peers.
