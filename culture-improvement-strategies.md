Specific actions that leaders and team members can take to improve organizational culture:

1. Build trust between teams through sustained interaction
2. Encourage lateral movement between departments
3. Create reward systems for collaborative work
4. Establish psychological safety for experimentation
5. Allocate dedicated time for learning and sharing
6. Implement regular knowledge-sharing events
