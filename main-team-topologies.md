There are many types of topologies, but only four that you need for a successful organization. If you find yourself having other types of topologies, you should attempt to move them into one of these four:
- Stream aligned team: focused on one valuable stream of work, i.e. a single product, feature, user story, etc. This is the main type of "team" in an org, and all other types exist only to make this type move faster, better, safer, etc. It should include all types of members needed in order to get the work flowing. This is a classic cross functional Scrum team.
- Enabling team: team that helps stream aligned teams stay up to date on tech, focus on best practices, use the most modern frameworks, etc. They should never depend on a stream aligned team, and vice versa, but should instead only assist until the stream aligned team becomes autonomous.
- Complicated subsystem team: team that works on very specific parts of the product, often small parts of software that require specialist knowledge. Things like mathematical algorithms, codes, drivers, etc are handled by this type of team.
- Platform team: manages the platform that the stream aligned team needs in order to do their work efficiently. This often includes APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support. If a platform is large enough, managing it can include all the other types of teams, in addition to a platform team for the platform itself. 

There are only four types of topologies you need to know about:
- Stream aligned team.
- Enabling team.
- Complicated-subsystem team.
- Platform team.


Stream aligned teams should include members that are capable of performing all actions needed to get the work flowing. I.e. there should be zero need for handoff & each member must likely perform more than one task.

Enabling teams help stream aligned teams stay up to date on tech, best practices, frameworks, etc. They should  never be dependent on each other, but should assist for a while until stream-aligned team becomes autonomous. 

Complicated subsystem teams work of (often) small parts of software that require almost exlusovely specialist knowledge. This can be things like mathematical algorithms, codecs, drivers, etc. Delivery should be fast and integration w/ stream aligned teams is important.

Platform teams ensure that the platform needed by stream algined teams to work autonomously is in place. This includes self service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support.

If a platform is large enough, managing it can incolce all of the other team types as well as another platform team for the platform itself.
