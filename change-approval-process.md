Research shows that heavyweight change approval processes, particularly Change Advisory Boards (CABs), negatively impact both performance and stability. Effective change management should:

1. Keep approval processes lightweight
2. Automate controls where possible
3. Use continuous integration for automated testing
4. Implement peer review through pull requests
5. Trust teams to make appropriate decisions

Having no process at all is actually better than having a CAB in terms of both performance and stability metrics.
