Tidy books the same way you do clothes. Gather all your books in one big pile, touch every one, and keep only the ones that spark joy. You will not read the unread books if you have not already done so, so they can be discarded.

For books that you have already read, ask yourself if you are _really_ going to read them again. If not, they can be discarded.
