xss is on the rise, new record in 2024 most likely. Why?

Why is xss a problem? Because of SOP. JS can only access things of the same origin as defined by the ietf. 

Code injected into your page through XSS can access the same stuff as your own JS.

Browsers tried to protect from XSS. Filter was designed to be fast and not good, so it didn't work very well. It was then removed.

CSP - content security policy. Defines where you can load content from based on a header.

Inline styles will not work when csp is set. Same for inline js, eval, setInterval, etc. So this needs to be refactored. Inline styles might not be such a big issue to enable, but should be avoided.

Can greenlight certain inline coding using hash of the code.

`report-uri` can be added, which will be called w/ post request when csp fails for some reason. This is great to find xss or if marketing adds something new w/o your consent. Use for reporting only in the beginning to get data, then enable csp.

trusted types prevents your from using innerHTML.
