Modularity / Complexity is defined as the relationship between strength and distance, i.e. how tightly coupled something is and how far apart code is.

| Strength / Distance | High                                   | Low                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High                | Global complexity                      | Loosely coupled components. This is good.                                    |
| Low                 | High cohesion component. This is good. | Code that is note related is kept close together. Leads to local complexity. |

It's important to note here that even though the strength and distance are low, this does not necessarily mean a positive outcome as with the other pairs.
