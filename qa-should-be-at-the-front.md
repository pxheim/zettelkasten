In the development process, QA should always be at the front, i.e. before actual development has started. They should help define the system in terms of tests along with business analysts.  They should define [[acceptance-tests]] for the developers to write.

QA should never be at the end of the process. If they are, we are expecting them to find bugs, and by extension we then expect developers to not do their job properly. If developers do their job properly and QA is at the end, they will never find anything.

QA should do exploratory testing, i.e. testing that needs human interaction, ingenuity, intuition or insight.
