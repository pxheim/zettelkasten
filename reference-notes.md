A reference note is a note that is a direct reference to a quote by someone else. When reading a book the highlights you make are the equivalent of reference notes. This allows you to immerse yourself in the content you're reading without worrying about whether you should highlight something or not.

Make sure to include page number or chapter number for where the reference is taken from so that you can refer back to it later.

Be warned though, making reference notes requires no thinking, and thus does not make you learn. You have spend effort thinking about your reference notes and turn them into [[literature-notes]] to actually [[elaboration-best-way-to-learn.md|elaborate]] on what you have read.
