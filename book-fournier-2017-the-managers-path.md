Managing has two extremes, micromanaging and "benign neglect", neither of which is where you want to be.

1:1 are not your manager's responsibility to make sure they go well. They are a venue for you to share and be personal w/ your manager, but also where you can get feedback. Good managers are quick to give feedback.

Your manager is not responsible for your training or conferences or whatnot that you want to attend. Request them.

Ultimately you are responsible for yourself, so whenever you want something, ask. Worst that happens is that you get a no.

Mentoring is a great way to get into and see if you like the whole manager thing. You get to practice listening, project management, communication and more w/o too much consequences.

Good idea to have the intern present the project they have been working on when their time is up. Because they will (should) have a project. If they are with you for 10 weeks, find a project that takes 5 weeks to complete.

Having a mentee is a good opportunity for you to remember what it was like seeing the company for the first time.

What you measure, you improve.

Tech Lead is not the best developer. Needs to represent devs to managers. A person responsible for dev team that codes 30%.

Tech Lead must step away from your code. Your team's needs are more important than your own work. Comes down to balance.

3 main roles as a tech lead during projects: systems architect & business analyst, project planner & regular developer.

Project planning is a good practice in self-discipline. Figure out how to do something before heading head first into code.

Project planning is very important for a Team Lead.

As a tech lead, don't get too caught up in processes. Understand that they are necessary, but need to be modified to work for the team you are managing.

Most important when being a tech lead:

- Understand the architecture well.
- Put your team above personal goals.
- Lead tech decisions, but do not make them on your own. You represent the team, so confer w/ them.
- Communicate well, and work on soft skills related to this (presentations, writing, etc.).

The best mindset to keep when promoted to tech lead is that you are again a junior.

Make a 30/60/90 day play when creating a report w/ someone new. Also makes it easy to weed out the mishires.

Make new hires / contribute to a set of onboarding documents.

Establish clearly what is expected from the new hire & how you tend to lead.

Make sure you have weekly 1:1s at least to start off with. You can always reduce the frequency later.

For 1:1 there are many styles: catching up, progress report, friendly chart, todo-list meeting, etc. Try to mix it up, but be aware that you should have a progress report ~quarterly.

Don't wait for a 1:1 to give feedback.

Delegation is not the same as abdication! You can delegate & follow up w/o micro managing. In fact this is what makes a good manager: work together w/ the things you delegate.

Having standards in place ensures that the work you delegate is at least up to that w/o having to micro manage.

When do you _have_ to micro manage? Ask you team about the status. If after a week you don't get anything, it's time for you to poke around.

**Act at the next level of promotion before being promoted to it. Prevents promoting people to their level of incompetence**

Fundamental rule of management: there should be no surprises.

---

Even when managing teams, do not stop coachin, at least not until you are absolutely confident that you have reached a point where you can stop.

Shielding your team is good, but only to a certain extent. Don't "hide" things from them, and don't become a parent.

Create a data-driven culture! What you don't measure you don't improve. Retrospectives and feedback are also data! Even though it's subjective data.

You have about 10 productive weeks per quarter. 20% should go towards tech-debt.

Off the cuff estimates should be doubled, but inform that you need more time to be certain.

Don't make your teammates estimate things all the time, only when needed.

# Atomic Notes

Title: tech-lead-responsibilities
Content: A Tech Lead's primary focus should be team representation and technical leadership rather than being the best developer. The role typically involves 30% coding time, with the remainder split between systems architecture, business analysis, and project planning. The key responsibilities include understanding architecture deeply, prioritizing team needs over personal goals, and leading (not dictating) technical decisions through team collaboration.
Links: [[technical-leadership-fundamentals]], [[planning-importance]]

Title: leadership-mindset
Content: When promoted to a technical leadership position, adopt a "junior mindset" - approaching the new role as a learner despite technical expertise. This mindset helps navigate the transition from individual contributor to leader and maintains humility while developing new skills.
Links: [[technical-leadership-fundamentals]], [[management-growth]]

Title: delegation-principles
Content: Effective delegation requires ongoing engagement rather than complete handoff (abdication). Good managers maintain involvement through follow-up while avoiding micromanagement. Having clear standards in place helps ensure quality work without excessive oversight. Micromanagement becomes necessary only when regular status updates are consistently missing.
Links: [[management-practices]], [[management-balance]]

Title: management-balance
Content: Effective management requires finding the right balance between two extremes: micromanagement and "benign neglect". Neither extreme is desirable, as both can harm team productivity and growth. The goal is to provide appropriate oversight while maintaining team autonomy.
Links: [[delegation-principles]], [[management-practices]]

Title: one-on-one-principles
Content: One-on-one meetings serve as a venue for personal sharing, feedback, and progress tracking. While various styles exist (casual catch-ups, progress reports, friendly chats, todo-list reviews), quarterly progress reviews are essential. The effectiveness of these meetings is primarily the direct report's responsibility, not the manager's.
Links: [[management-practices]], [[feedback-delivery]]

Title: feedback-delivery
Content: Effective feedback should be timely and not restricted to scheduled one-on-ones. Good managers provide quick feedback when needed. This immediate approach helps prevent surprises, which violates a fundamental rule of management.
Links: [[management-practices]], [[one-on-one-principles]]

Title: measurement-culture
Content: Creating a data-driven culture is essential for continuous improvement. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback (from retrospectives) constitute valuable data points. The principle "what you measure, you improve" applies to both technical and process improvements.
Links: [[management-practices]], [[planning-importance]]

Title: planning-importance
Content: Project planning is crucial for technical leaders and requires self-discipline to resist diving directly into code. Teams typically have 10 productive weeks per quarter, with 20% allocated to technical debt. Quick estimates should be doubled, and estimation should be required only when necessary.
Links: [[technical-leadership-fundamentals]], [[measurement-culture]]

Title: new-hire-onboarding
Content: Successful onboarding involves creating a 30/60/90 day plan, maintaining clear documentation, establishing expectations and leadership style, and conducting frequent initial one-on-ones. This structured approach helps identify potential issues early and sets new team members up for success.
Links: [[management-practices]], [[one-on-one-principles]]

Title: management-growth
Content: To avoid the Peter Principle (promotion to incompetence), individuals should demonstrate capabilities at the next level before being promoted. Mentoring provides a low-risk opportunity to develop management skills like listening, project management, and communication.
