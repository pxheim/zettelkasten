Managing has two extremes, micromanaging and "benign neglect", neither of which is where you want to be.

1:1 are not your manager's responsibility to make sure they go well. They are a venue for you to share and be personal w/ your manager, but also where you can get feedback. Good managers are quick to give feedback.

Your manager is not responsible for your training or conferences or whatnot that you want to attend. Request them.

Ultimately you are responsible for yourself, so whenever you want something, ask. Worst that happens is that you get a no.

Mentoring is a great way to get into and see if you like the whole manager thing. You get to practice listening, project management, communication and more w/o too much consequences.

Good idea to have the intern present the project they have been working on when their time is up. Because they will (should) have a project. If they are with you for 10 weeks, find a project that takes 5 weeks to complete.

Having a mentee is a good opportunity for you to remember what it was like seeing the company for the first time.

What you measure, you improve.

Tech Lead is not the best developer. Needs to represent devs to managers. A person responsible for dev team that codes 30%.

Tech Lead must step away from your code. Your team's needs are more important than your own work. Comes down to balance.

3 main roles as a tech lead during projects: systems architect & business analyst, project planner & regular developer.

Project planning is a good practice in self-discipline. Figure out how to do something before heading head first into code.

Project planning is very important for a Team Lead.

As a tech lead, don't get too caught up in processes. Understand that they are necessary, but need to be modified to work for the team you are managing.

Most important when being a tech lead:

- Understand the architecture well.
- Put your team above personal goals.
- Lead tech decisions, but do not make them on your own. You represent the team, so confer w/ them.
- Communicate well, and work on soft skills related to this (presentations, writing, etc.).

The best mindset to keep when promoted to tech lead is that you are again a junior.

Make a 30/60/90 day play when creating a report w/ someone new. Also makes it easy to weed out the mishires.

Make new hires / contribute to a set of onboarding documents.

Establish clearly what is expected from the new hire & how you tend to lead.

Make sure you have weekly 1:1s at least to start off with. You can always reduce the frequency later.

For 1:1 there are many styles: catching up, progress report, friendly chart, todo-list meeting, etc. Try to mix it up, but be aware that you should have a progress report ~quarterly.

Don't wait for a 1:1 to give feedback.

Delegation is not the same as abdication! You can delegate & follow up w/o micro managing. In fact this is what makes a good manager: work together w/ the things you delegate.

Having standards in place ensures that the work you delegate is at least up to that w/o having to micro manage.

When do you _have_ to micro manage? Ask you team about the status. If after a week you don't get anything, it's time for you to poke around.

**Act at the next level of promotion before being promoted to it. Prevents promoting people to their level of incompetence**

Fundamental rule of management: there should be no surprises.

Even when managing teams, do not stop coachin, at least not until you are absolutely confident that you have reached a point where you can stop.

Shielding your team is good, but only to a certain extent. Don't "hide" things from them, and don't become a parent.

Create a data-driven culture! What you don't measure you don't improve. Retrospectives and feedback are also data! Even though it's subjective data.

You have about 10 productive weeks per quarter. 20% should go towards tech-debt.

Off the cuff estimates should be doubled, but inform that you need more time to be certain.

Don't make your teammates estimate things all the time, only when needed.
