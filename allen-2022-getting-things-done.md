A bottom-up approach to changing how an organization works is the best approach. High flying, top-down commitments usually get lost as people are too focused on their day-to-day actions.

Keeping a reference for things that do not go into ZK needs to happen. E.g. contact information, dates that require no action, etc. It will be very individual how you want to and should store this.

Order of working with the system should be calendar first, the next actions, then projects, then other lists if you have time.

After 2 years of GTD, do a "big picture review" where you consider the larger picture. You need to have your life in order first before you do this. That takes 2 years.

System for note-taking needs to facilitate the ability to quickly take notes about everything. Do not worry about organizing just yet.

To your brain, every task is equally important so cleaning the attic and complete company merger take up the same amount of mental capacity, just different contexts.

Organizations are only as strong as their weakest links, something that also applies to GTD or more generally, communication and responsibility. You cannot force people to adopt GTD, but you can give them info about it and through using GTD yourself you can hold them accountable.

Always always always ask, even yourself, "what's the next action?". Will change your mind.

Bright people procrastinate because the see all the things can consequences of the stuff they need to do. Break the cycle by creating specific next actions.

Do not mistake lon-term to mean projects in the future. Instead consider them for what they are, projects with more next-actions than normal ones.

Asking what's the next action promotes clarity, accountability, productivity and empowerment. In other words, you get a sense of what needs to be done and who is going to do it, align on what needs to be done and empowers the people who now has complete control of what actually needs to be done.

All of the ideas of GTD can and should be applies to a company level as well. Makes for a productive org.

The mind is a pattern recognition machine and an amazingly good one at that. However, it's terrible at remembering things. So by realizing this, we externalize the remembering process and let the brain do what it's good at.

Learning GTD is like any other skill. It requires work, practice, training, etc.
