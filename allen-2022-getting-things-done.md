A bottom-up approach to changing how an organization works is the best approach. High flying, top-down commitments usually get lost as people are too focused on their day-to-day actions.

The calendar tasks are sacred. Only put things into your calendar that really truly need to be done on a specific day / time. It may be tempting to overload the calendar with other things you think you are going to do on a day, but refrain from doing this.

You most likely need to split your next-actions into multiple lists. Initially the best way to do this is to split them up into context based lists, e.g.
- Calls
- At computer
- At office
- At home
- Errands
- Anywhere
- Agendas
- Read / Review
This way, you can easily figure out if you can do something or not. Are you at the office, well, that rules out the at home list. Do you have some minutes to spare? Maybe a call would be good.

Agendas are super useful. You should keep a list for each person you interact with. Similarly agendas can be useful to keep for recurring meetings such as standups.

The waiting for list must always contain a date for when you gave the task to someone, and a due date / reminder for you to follow up on whether the task was completed or not. It does not have to be the deadline for the task, and it might even be best if the reminder is set some time before the deadline.

GTD advocates keeping email as a separate system as it's probably not going to be efficient to move your emails into other lists. Make some lists in your email software and clarify and organize them directly there.

Almost everything you do turn into projects, i.e. they last a while and require more than 1 next-action to complete. I'ts very important to get all projects down on paper or into software you are using. Problems you wish to solve and things you want to learn are all projects.

Sorting projects into sub-projects can be tempting, but be cautious here. Start off simple with one project first, even if the list is long.

Delegated projects are a hybrid between a project and a waiting for item. They are useful to keep around for managers that delegate a lot of work.

Projects often come with support material. Very often this is project specific and does not have to go into ZK unless relevant. Sort this information in each specific project as project reference material.

Keeping a reference for things that do not go into ZK needs to happen. E.g. contact information, dates that require no action, etc. It will be very individual how you want to and should store this.

Someday / Maybe lists seem to end up with a few specific categories:
- Projects you're not going to work on for the next 5-6 months.
- Dreams and things you want to do, typically bucket list stuff.
- Other lists of things like books to read, wines to try, recipes to make, etc.

Use the calendar to remind you to check in on projects at a later day. It's a useful way to make sure you check in on things you delay. It's also useful to set up reminders for yourself for actions you defer due to internal factors, e.g. "I need to sleep on this before making a decision".

Checklists are a great way to ensure that you follow a procedure when it's new to you, e.g. GTD. These lists can be set up as reminders for you to perform certain actions, or just useful for things you need to start doing.

Order of working with the system should be calendar first, the next actions, then projects, then other lists if you have time.
