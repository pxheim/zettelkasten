Keeping a reference for things that do not go into ZK needs to happen. E.g. contact information, dates that require no action, etc. It will be very individual how you want to and should store this.

[[create-checklists-for-new-processes]]

Order of working with the system should be calendar first, the next actions, then projects, then other lists if you have time.

After 2 years of GTD, do a "big picture review" where you consider the larger picture. You need to have your life in order first before you do this. That takes 2 years.

System for note-taking needs to facilitate the ability to quickly take notes about everything. Do not worry about organizing just yet.

[[disintegrated-self-trust]]

To your brain, every task is equally important so cleaning the attic and complete company merger take up the same amount of mental capacity, just different contexts.

Always always always ask, even yourself, "what's the next action?". Will change your mind.

Bright people procrastinate because the see all the things can consequences of the stuff they need to do. Break the cycle by creating specific next actions.
