Having too much to to is not the source of negative feelings. If it was, we would feel bad all the time because there's always too much to do. Instead, it's the breaking of the agreement or obligation you have made to do something that results in you feeling bad.

The best ways to avoid breaking agreements are:
- Don't make them in the first place.
- Fulfill the agreement.
- Renegotiate it.

The first might seem harsh, but in reality it shows that you have discipline. Saying no to something you do not have time to do is better than saying yes and not completing it.
