SOLID is an acronym used in software development that facilitates 5 good practices you should always adhere to:

- [[single-responsibility-principle]]: A class should have only one reason to change, i.e. it should only have one job or responsibility.
- [[open-closed-principle]]: A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- [[liskov-substitution-principle]]: A subclass should be able to stand in for it's superclass.
- [[interface-segregation-principle]]: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't need.
- [[dependency-inversion-principle]]: High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
