The third dysfunction is a lack of commitment, which often comes from a wish to have consensus or certainty. Consensus is something that is rarely achievable, thus trying to reach it is likely to result in a lack of commitment unless everybody knows this. Similarly, the decision that might be made might not be the one everybody agrees on initially, but everybody should be on board with it being the decision made. I.e. commit to the decision even though you disagree, then, if you fail, you fail fast and can pivot.

In order to for this to work you need everybody to feel like they had their opinions heard. As mentioned, they might not all be taken into account, but at least they are voiced.

In order to achieve commitment:
- Cascading messages. After any meeting involving your peers, go over what the next actions for are. This ensures you are in agreement, but also ensures that communication downwards is the same coming from all executives. [[working-with-next-actions]]
- Deadlines: Commit to deadlines for when decision will be made.
- Contingency and worst case: If struggling to commit, evaluate worst case first, then, when that's not too bad, making a decision might get easier.
- Low risk exposure therapy: Be very clear about even small decisions. Also do not spend too much time gathering data for decisions up front. That can come later.

As a leader you must be comfortable making decisions that ultimately turn out to be wrong. Also you must be fine not reaching a consensus and then being the tie breaker.

Lack of commitment leads to [[dysfunction-4-avoidance-of-accountability]] as when you're not committed you cannot be held accountable. You simply do not care.
