A module's cost of change is the relationship between volatility and distance, i.e. how often a module is expected to change and how far apart code is.

| Volatility / Distance | High                                                           | Low                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High                  | High cost of change                                            | Low cost of change. High distance is offset by low volatility. |
| Low                   | Low cost of change. High volatility is offset by low distance. | Low cost of change                                             |
