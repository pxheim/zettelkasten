When refactoring, do not concern yourself with performance. Certain refactorings will seem to degrade performance, but this is fine. Well factored code is easier to refactor later compared to messy code.

Additionally, we are terrible at intuitively knowing what causes performance to drop and whether it's significant or not. Compilers do a lot of magic.
