Trunk-based development is essential for effective Continuous Delivery. This approach involves:

1. Working directly in the main branch or using short-lived feature branches
2. Merging branches at least daily
3. Avoiding long-lived feature branches
4. Using feature toggles for incomplete work

While GitHub Flow might work for open source projects, it's not optimal for continuous delivery in most organizational contexts.
