When planning, one of the most important things to do is defining what success will look like, i.e. what is a successful outcome. This should ideally allow us to stay focused on meeting this outcome.

However, when planning, do not use the outcome as a means to estimate how long it'll take you to get there. [do-not-estimate-time-based-on-outcome](do-not-estimate-time-based-on-outcome.md).
