Doing CI requires a change in mindset when coming from "regular" development.

- Every change can potentially be released.
- "Done" means that something is released to production. This means that a developer cannot alone make something done. The whole team w/ QA has to, thus making everybody responsible for the delivery process.
- Traditionally your application is broken until you prove that it's not (through tests, etc.). With CI, your application is always assumed to be working until it's not.
