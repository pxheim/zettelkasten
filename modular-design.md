Based on the [[definition-of-module]], it should follow that "modular design" is a system comprised of well defined modules, but it's not that simple. Breaking a monolith down into multiple well defined modules might not make for a better system. It might in fact make things worse.

**A modular system is defined by "the arrows between the boxes", i.e. how the different modules interact with one another.**
