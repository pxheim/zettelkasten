Teams should never be larger than 7-9 people. This is due to Dunbar's number that sets a limit for how many people you can trust intimately. Going above this number puts you at risk of [[dysfunction-1-lack-of-trust]].

This is often referred to as a "two pizza team", as it's the amount of people you can feed with 2 pizzas.
