One of the most important aspects of the GTD workflow is the weekly review. It's recommended that you reserve 2 hours at the end of your working week to review your calendar (post and future), next-action lists, projects and basically everything except for your reference material.

During the weekly review you are supposed to get clear, current and creative. The clear one refers to making sure you clean up everything from the week prior, e.g. new things in your in-boxes that have not been defined, tasks that have not been marked as complete, and so on. The current one refers to getting up to date on what you're going to do moving forward. Getting creative is what you do afterwards where you reflect with a fresh mind on things both past and present. Perhaps something in your someday / maybe list is now relevant?
