The best way to ensure that something gets done is to take some time and define exactly what you want to achieve with the thing, and the next physical action you need to take in order to make this thing move closer towards the desired outcome. In short:

1. Define desired outcome.
2. Defined next physical action.
3. Make a reminder to do said action.

When thinking about what you need to do, it's often tempting to just do the action. This is sometimes fine ([[2-minute-rule]]), but most often the best way to tackle a task is to properly think about it first, going through the three steps above.

An example of a poorly defined next-action might be to "clean the garden shed", whereas the actual next physical action should be something like "drive the bags of trash to IVAR".

There are 7 main categories to keep next-actions in to keep them organized:

- Projects [[projects--stuff-with-multiple-actions]]
- Project support material: [[project-support-material]]
- Calendar actions: [[use-calendar-for-time-and-date-sensitive-actions]]
- Next lists: [[sorting-next-actions-into-lists]]
- Waiting-for lists: [[waiting-for-lists]]
- Reference material: [[working-with-notes-set-zettelkasten-apart]]
- Someday / Maybe list: [[someday-maybe-lists-for-the-future]]

A great habit to get into, regardless or whether you are clarifying your projects or not is to [[always-ask-what-is-the-next-action]].
