The best way to ensure that something gets done is to take some time and define exactly what you want to achieve with the thing, and the next physical action you need to take in order to make this thing move closer towards the desired outcome. In short:

1. Define desired outcome.
2. Defined next physical action.
3. Make a reminder to do said action.

When thinking about what you need to do, it's often tempting to just do the action. This is sometimes fine ([[2-minute-rule]]), but most often the best way to tackle a task is to properly think about it first, going through the three steps above.

An example of a poorly defined next-action might be to "clean the garden shed", whereas the actual next physical action should be something like "drive the bags of trash to IVAR".

When a stuff has been given a next-action, it should be organized into one of three possible places:

1. Calendar for time / day specific events. [[use-calendar-for-time-and-date-sensitive-actions]]
2. Next-action lists [[sorting-next-actions-into-lists]]
3. Waiting for lists. [[waiting-for-lists]]

A great habit to get into, regardless or whether you are clarifying your projects or not is to [[always-ask-what-is-the-next-action]].
