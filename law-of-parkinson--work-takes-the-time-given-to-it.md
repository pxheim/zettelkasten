The law of Parkinson states that every kind of work will take up the time we set aside for it. This holds true for longer timeframes, i.e. if you estimate that coding something is going to take 2 days, it will likely take 2 days (or longer [over-confidence-bias--people-cannot-estimate](over-confidence-bias--people-cannot-estimate.md)).

However for shorter tasks that can be completed in one go, this no longer holds true, possibly due to the [zeigarnik-effect--unfinished-things-remain-in-our-brain](zeigarnik-effect--unfinished-things-remain-in-our-brain.md) which keeps us pre-occupied with the task. It's akin to speeding up when seeing the finish line.
