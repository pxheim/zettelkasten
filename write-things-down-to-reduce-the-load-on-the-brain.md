The brain is not willing to give up a task that is not complete unless we trick the brain into thinking we've taken care of it. This can be done by writing down a task. The brain does not actually care whether the task is actually done, or you've just written it down. This is the power of a system that allows you to offload your brain, enabling you to focus on what's important.

Create a system that will take care of the things that occupies the ego so that you can free your brain to work on the important bits. The system needs to work as a whole. If the tools you add to the system do not work together, then it's pointless.
