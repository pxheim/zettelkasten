In order for an organization to be as productive as it can be, each individual needs to employ a well structures personal workflow. GTD is one of these, and does not have to be the one, but if you cannot rely on the people you work with to keep up with what's going on, then the organization is never going to be as efficient as it can be.

You do not have to preach GTD to your colleagues, but you can mention it if they are interested. More likely, if you are on top of things yourself, you can keep people accountable through [[waiting-for-lists]].
