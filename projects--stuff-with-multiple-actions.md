Projects are defined as stuff you want to do that require more than 1 action to complete. Not surprisingly, this is going to be the majority of the things you wish to do.

When starting with gtd, it's common to have a lot of next-actions, but not too many projects. When you get better, you'll find yourself working more and more with projects.

Sorting projects into sub-projects can be tempting, but be cautious here. Start off simple with one project first, even if the list is long.

A sign that a project you have created require more planning is that that either still on your mind even though you have defined a next action for it, or that you get ad-hoc ideas for this projects when you're out and about. These projects should ideally have a next action to reflect this, e.g. gather more data about X, research Y, brainstorm about Z, etc. It can also be setting up meetings or talking to people about the project.
