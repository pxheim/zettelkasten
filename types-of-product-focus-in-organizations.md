In a product focused organization, when a project is complete and shipped to customers, there's always someone that checks whether this created value for the customers. Alternatives include:
- Project based: when one project is done, another one can be started w/o checking whether what you built actually crated value.
- Sales led: what you build depends on what has been "sold" to your customers.
- Visionary led: what you build depends on a visionary, e.g. Steve Jobs in Apple. This can work for some time, but is rarely sustainable.
- Tech led: what you build depends on what's the latest and greatest within the tech space you are working. It's important to evaluate new tech, but it does not alone drive value.
