Calendar must only contain things that need to be done on a specific day and things that need to be done on a specific time during a day, e.g. an appointment. Do not use the calendar for your daily todo list. This will dilute the importance of the things in the calendar that actually needs to be done on that day.

It may be tempting to add to the things you think you are going to do on a day, but refrain from doing this.
