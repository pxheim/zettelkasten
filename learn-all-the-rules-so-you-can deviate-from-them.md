When learning something new, you're often bound to the rules of the new thing you are learning, but as you get more familiar with it, you feel more comfortable exploring deviations from the rules, as you know how far you can stretch them. It's like the saying "learn all the rules so you know which ones you do not nee to follow". In essence, the better you know something, the more open you are to new ideas.
