Conway's law states that when organizations create systems, they are inevitably going to create systems are mirror the communication structure. So, if you design your organization to work in silos, you are not going to have a product that works well end-to-end.

Given Conway's law, that org. design directly influences system architecture, indirectly, whoever decides on the org. structure will decide the architecture. It then follows that these people need to be of a technical nature for success.

Using this to create the systems you want is called the [[reverse-conway-maneuver]].
