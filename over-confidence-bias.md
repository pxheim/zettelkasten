People are absolutely terrible at estimating how long something is going to take. Even when faced with the question of estimating how long something is going to take under the worst possible conditions do we manage to accurately estimate things. And worse yet, when faced with the knowledge that we're terrible at estimating, we still cannot estimate accurately, although, marginally better. This is called the over-confidence bias.
