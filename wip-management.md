Work in Progress (WIP) limits alone don't improve performance. They become effective when combined with publicly available information dashboards, which together positively impact both performance and culture.

Key elements:
1. WIP limits must be visible
2. Information dashboards should be public
3. Combined approach improves performance
4. Cultural benefits from transparency
5. Regular monitoring and adjustment needed
