What makes acceptance tests so important is that they are not just tests that verify that your application does what the customer wants, they are also executable specifications of the behavior of the program.

When just referring to acceptance tests, we most often mean functional acceptance tests. This is different from [[nonfunctional-acceptance-tests]].
