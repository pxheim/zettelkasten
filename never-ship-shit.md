Not one of the main parts of [[software-craftsmanship]], but still important, is that you should never allow yourself to ship shit. Which means, never ship code to production that

- Contains known bugs
- Untested functions
- Poorly written functions
- Has dependency on details
- Has unnecessary couplings

Take pride in your work and keep the promise to your customers (and colleagues) to never ship shit. Never accept that bugs are just a natural part of our software.

Quality of everything else in our world increases, so why should software be any different?
