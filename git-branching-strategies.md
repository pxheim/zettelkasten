There are three main git branching strategies that are prevalent in software development. Ranging from most complex to least complex, they are

1. Git Flow [[git-flow]] - An outdated branching method.
2. GitHub Flow [[git-hub-flow]] - Single main branch + feature branches.
3. GitLab Flow [[git-lab-flow]]  - Multiple releases at once.
