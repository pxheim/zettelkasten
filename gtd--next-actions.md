[[gtd--next-action-lists]]

The best way to ensure that something gets done is to take some time and define exactly what you want to achieve with the thing, and the next physical action you need to take in order to make this thing move closer towards the desired outcome. In short:

1. Define desired outcome.
2. Defined next physical action.
3. Make a reminder to do said action.

When thinking about what you need to do, it's often tempting to just do the action. This is sometimes fine ([[2-minute-rule]]), but most often the best way to tackle a task is to properly think about it first, going through the three steps above.

An example of a poorly defined next-action might be to "clean the garden shed", whereas the actual next physical action should be something like "drive the bags of trash to IVAR".






Asking what's the next action promotes clarity, accountability, productivity and empowerment. In other words, you get a sense of what needs to be done and who is going to do it, align on what needs to be done and empowers the people who now has complete control of what actually needs to be done.

When a task has been given a next-action, it should go be organized into one of three possible places:

1. Calendar for time / day specific events.
2. Next-action lists
3. Waiting for lists.




When defining next actions, projects with multiple moving components should have an action assigned to each as long as they do not depend on each other or other component's next actions. A next action can be to plan your next actions. This is fine. You need to plan enough to get your mind to relax, i.e. get it out of your head. If you're still thinking about something after you have planned it, you most likely did not plan it well enough.
