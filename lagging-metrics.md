Lagging metrics are a type of product metric whose result depend on data for some time before you can measure it. User retention is a type of lagging metric as you don't know your retention rate before some time has past and the user(s) have left. If you need to measure a lagging metric, find the metrics leading to the lagging metric, e.g. happiness and satisfaction are metrics that lead to retention.
