[[tidy-everywhere-all-at-once]]

When you want to start tidying, i.e. throwing things out, the most effective way is to do it all at once.

Throwing away 1 item per day does not work as you'll soon forget to do it, save items to throw away later, etc. However, perhaps most importantly, it's hard to get an overview when tidying like this. This is also why tidying room by room does not work as we store the same things in multiple rooms.

Tidying by numbers does not work. "Keep x clothes" only works for the person that defined x. Only you know how many shoes you want to keep to be happy, but make sure you only keep the ones that spark joy. If you have 100 shoes where all of them spark joy, so be it.

[[tidy-first-then-store]]

Tidying does not mean putting things away, it means throwing things out. Don't put things you actually don't need in boxes that hide them away and then claim you have made it tidy. Discard everything first, then figure out where to place things. Don't let anything stop you from discarding until you have discarded everything (in a category).

[[does-it-spark-joy]]

Focus on what to keep, not what you want to discard. Pick up an item and ask yourself if it sparks joy. That feeling you get when you're holding something you really, _really_ like, that's what you are looking for. Discard the things that do not spark joy.

[[order-of-tidying]]

When tidying, start with clothes, then books, then papers, then misc items, then sentimental items last. This is the most efficient order, sorted by the order in which most people find it easy to discard items (sentimental items are hard to discard for everyone).

[[tidy-by-category]]

Consider everything you own, and start tidying by category.

1. Clothes.

Make a big pile of _all_ the clothes you have from all rooms. Then start sorting off season clothes before other ones. Reason for this is that you haven't just worn them, nor can you, so it should be easier to discard the ones you don't want.

Don't just downgrade clothes to loungewear instead of discarding. Self image is impacted by the stuff you wear at home, so wear something nice, even when you are not doing anything important.

Don't stow away seasonal clothes. Keep all your clothes up front. You never know when you'll have a warm October. This also makes it easier to get an overview of what you actually have.

2. Books

Tidy books the same way you do clothes. Gather all your books in one big pile, touch every one, and keep only the ones that spark joy. You will not read the unread books if you have not already done so, so they can be discarded.

For books that you have already read, ask yourself if you are _really_ going to read them again. If not, they can be discarded.

3. Papers

Rule of thumb is to discard all **papers**. You don't need to keep them around. Important ones you can digitize. The only exception is things you really truly must keep (like deeds, etc.) and sentimental papers.

4. Misc. (Komono)

It's hard to gather these in a pile, but often they'll fall under a specific category no less. Some people hoard Christmas decorations, other people hoard board games. Follow the same procedure for these, i.e. gather them by category in piles and sort through them.

5. Sentimental items

Truly precious memories will not Vanish because you discard the item that gave you the memory. If the item itself does not spark joy it can be discarded.

Don't sent sentimental items to another place like a cabin or parents' place. It's not a fourth dimension with infinite space. Deal with the items, ask yourself if they spark joy, and if they don't, discard them.

Tidying your past is good for your present self.

[[storage-when-tidying]]

Keep your storage solution as simple as possible; no fancy solutions. These often hide what you actually have and get in the way of getting an overview. Transparent boxes stacked on top of one another in a neat system still contains tons of items that you might not know you have. They are, however, great, but keep them to a minimum, avoid stacking and piling them.

Best storage container is a rectangular shoebox. Avoid other shapes.

Storage should be focused on making it easy to put something away, not getting something out. If it's easy to put away, you are more likely to do so, reducing clutter.

Everything should have a designated place, and every designated place should belong to only one thing. Similarly, each person in a household should have their own place to store their things. Do not share shelves or cabinets.

Store similar things together, don't store by frequency of use. The location where you store the items will sort out sorting by frequency of use by itself.

[[remove-visual-noise]]

Labels, ads and other branding is noisy, so remove them you can. The same goes for your storage space. Take example from Poland removing Billboard, or Czechia removing ads.

[[discarding-unused-items]]

Things can have fulfilled their purpose without being used in the traditional sense. E.g. clothes that have not been used can be thrown out as they gave you joy when you bought them. Gifts that you received that you have not used sparked joy when you received them. Their purpose is done, and can be discarded.

Folding beats hanging in terms of storage and care for your clothes. Don't stack like a store would. Stand them up so you can see what you have. Don't potato ball your socks.

Advocates that you should move all change your find to your wallet and _never_ a piggybank as it'll never be used then, just moved to a new location. Weird advice, but perhaps makes sense in a country that actually uses physical money.

Empty your bag every day. Should not be an issue when everything in your bad already has a designated place. Gives your bag the rest it deserves, and allows you to start fresh every day.

Don't store things in the shower or in the bathtub. Take whatever you need with you, and put it back whenever you're done. This prevents slimy nasty buildup, and makes it easier to clean the shower. Oof, sounds like a lot of work.

Avoid stocking up on things, even when they are on sale. Consider the price of storing such items in your home. Only buy what you need, when you need it.

Show respect for the things you choose to keep. Kondo treats them as if they were alive and thanks them for the job they've done. Maybe bit much, but show appreciation for the things you have and they will last longer.

You'll eventually regret discarding something. This is fine. Noone died, and you can most likely get whatever you discarded back.

Oh boy she goes total nutcase towards the end of the book.
