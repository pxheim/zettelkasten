[[tidy-everywhere-all-at-once]]

When you want to start tidying, i.e. throwing things out, the most effective way is to do it all at once. Throwing away 1 item per day does not work as you'll soon forget to do it, save items to throw away later, etc. However, perhaps most importantly, it's hard to get an overview when tidying like this. This is also why tidying room by room does not work as we store the same things in multiple rooms.

Consider everything you own, and start tidying by category.

Tidying does not mean putting things away, it means throwing things out. Don't put things you actually don't need in boxes that hide them away and then claim you have made it tidy. Discard everything first, then figure out where to place things. Don't let anything stop you from discarding until you have discarded everything (in a category).

[[does-it-spark-joy]]

Focus on what to keep, not what to discard. 

Does it spark joy?

Discard the things that do not spark joy.



Things can have fulfilled their purpose without being used in the traditional sense. E.g. clothes that have not been used can be thrown out as they gave you joy when you bought them.

When tidying, start with clothes, then books, then papers, then misc items, then sentimental items last. This is the most efficient, sorted by the order in which most people find it easy to discard items (sentimental items are hard to discard for everyone).

Clothes, make a big pile of _all_ the clothes you have. Then start sorting off season clothes before other ones. Reason for this is that you haven't just worn them, nor can you, so it should be easier to discard the ones you don't want.

Don't downgrade clothes to loungewear instead of discarding. Self image is impacted by the stuff you wear at home, so wear something nice.

Folding beats hanging in terms of storage and care for your clothes. Don't stack like a store would. Stand them up so you can see what you have. Don't potato ball your socks.

Don't stow away seasonal clothes. Keep all your clothes up front. You never know when you'll have a warm October. Also helps you always see what you have.

Tidy books the same way you do clothes. All books in one big pile, touch every one, keep only the ones that spark joy. You will not read the unread books if you have no already done so.

Discard all papers. Exception are thing you _must_ keep and sentimental ones. Other stuff goes, or can be digitized.

Advocates that you should move all change your find to your wallet and _never_ a piggybank as it'll never be used then, just moved to a new location. Weird advice, but perhaps makes sense in a country that actually uses physical money.

Truly precious memories will not Vanish because you discard the item that gave you the memory. If the item itself does not spark joy, toss it.

Don't sent sentimental items to another place like cabin or parents' place. It's not a fourth dimension with infinite space. Deal with the items, then discard them. Tidying your past is good for the present.

Tidying by numbers does not work. Keep x clothes works for the person that defined x. Only you know how many shoes you want to keep to be happy. But make sure you only keep the things that spark joy. Og you have 100 shoes where all of them spark joy, so be it.

Have a designated place for everything. Also make sure each place is designated to contain one thing.

Storage should be as simple as possible. No fancy solutions. They often hide what you actually have, and prevent you from discarding.

Each person in a household should have their own place to store stuff. Don't share shelves or cabinets.

Storage should be focused on making it easy to put something away, not getting something out. This reduces clutter. Remember, designated place for everything.

Store similar things together. Don't worry about sorting by frequency of usem the storage you choose will sort that out by itself.

The only type of storage container you need is rectangular boxes of various sizes. Shoeboxes are great. Avoid other shapes.

Empty your bag every day. Should not be an issue when everything in your bad already has a designated place. Gives your bag the rest it deserves, and allows you to start fresh every day.

Don't store things in the shower or in the bathtub. Take whatever you need with you, and put it back whenever you're done. This prevents slimy nasty buildup, and makes it easier to clean the shower. Oof, sounds like a lot of work.

Avoid stocking up on things, even when they are on sale. Consider the price of storing such items in your home. Only buy what you need, when you need it.

Visual noise is also a thing. Labels, ads and other branding is noisy. Remove if you can. The same goes for your storage space. Remove labels and visual noise. Take example from Poland removing Billboard, or Czechia removing ads.

Show respect for the things you choose to keep. Kondo treats them as if they were alive and thanks them for the job they've done. Maybe bit much, but show appreciation for the things you have and they will last longer.

You'll eventually regret discarding something. This is fine. Noone died, and you can most likely get whatever you discarded back.

Oh boy she goes total nutcase towards the end of the book.
