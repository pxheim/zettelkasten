When engaging with your lists and deciding on what to do, there are 4 main things you should consider, in order:

1. Your current context. I.e. where are you now and what do you have access to? If you are in the office in front of your computer, you cannot do things that require you to be at home. This is why when [[sorting-next-actions-into-lists]], you want to sort them into lists based on context first.
2. The second thing you need to consider is how much time you have. If you only have 5 minutes, you might have time for a call or a quick action, but if you have a hour, it would be a waste of that time slot to do 12 of your 5-minute actions.
3. Energy level - if you are low on energy, you might go for some quick wins or easy tasks.
4. Lastly, after considering the above, pick the task that is the most important right now. Order of importance should be:
	1. Calendar
	2. Next actions
	3. Projects
	4. Anything else.
	What is most important within those categories might often simply come down to gut feeling.
