# Notes

GTD can be broken down into three main parts. (1) capture everything that needs to be done in a system that frees your brain, (2) decide selectively on which things you allow to be tackled, and thus always know what the next thing to focus on is, and (3) organize and maintain all the things you need to get done.

A bottom-up approach to changing how an organization works is the best approach. High flying, top-down commitments usually get lost as people are too focused on their day-to-day actions.
