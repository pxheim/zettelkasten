Things you are not going to do now, but you still need to get out of your head should go in a someday / maybe list. What lists you need are very individual, but usually the most common categories are:

- Projects you're not going to work on for the next 5-6 months.
- Dreams and things you want to do, typically bucket list stuff.
- Other lists of things like books to read, wines to try, recipes to make, etc.
