You most likely need to split your next-actions into multiple lists. Initially the best way to do this is to split them up into context based lists, e.g.

- Calls
- At computer
- At office
- At home
- Errands
- Anywhere
- Agendas
- Read / Review

This way, you can easily figure out if you can do something or not. Are you at the office, well, that rules out the at home list. Do you have some minutes to spare? Maybe a call would be good.
