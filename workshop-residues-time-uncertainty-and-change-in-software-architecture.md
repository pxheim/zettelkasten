O'Reilly, B. (2024, June 10). _Residues: Time, change, and uncertainty in software architecture_ [Workshop].

Residuality theory. Scientific theory of how we can do architecture. Peer reviewed.

How do you make design decisions?
- Collect information from stakeholders?
- Identify constrains rel. to project.
- Evaluate pros and cons of varying solutions. Which one fits the bill for the project in question.

Gut feeling is the root of most decisions when it comes to coding and architecture. However, gut feeling is not "random". Your gut feeling is the years of experience telling you subconsciously what's the right path.

Standard ways of represent architecture (UML, etc.) does not have way to factor in time, change, over time and uncertainty of change.

How do you deal with time, change and uncertainty:
- Small services.
- Don't worry about it? (most commonly)
- Grouping by business logic.
- Agile (everything is going to change, so let's not worry about it)

You don't get to control time, change and uncertainty. You need to deal with it and work around it.

What is your unit of software architecture? It depends on what "level" you are on. Business might have "features" as their unit, whereas a developer will think about "services". Design and developers do the same thing. You cannot take a design and break it down into services without some form of mapping.

Proposed new unit for software engineering is **residue**.

Everyone is doing architecture differently as we've all learned it from different places. We are all formed by the path we go through in our carreers.
