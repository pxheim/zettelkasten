# Chapter 1

You are not your user. Do not get caught up in designing something the way you want it. You have to design it the way your users would want it in order to truly design something that people will want vs. just enthusiasts. Similarly, don't get caught up in the way you want things to be when conduction research. Stay neutral.

When interviewing users, they are not magically going to give you all their needs that you can then go ahead and implement. It's a longer process where insights need to be filtered out from other potential noise coming from the customer.

> Don't design for yourself, but don't design just for the customer either.

Some pain points are not painful enough. People's tolerance to "good enough" solutions is referred to as "satisficing", coined by Herbert Simon. You might find that there are many things you or your customer want to have, but the pain of not having it is not great enough to really matter.

Talking to customers can also help reframe your perspective on what you are trying to achieve, e.g. seeing it from another perspective, turning it on its head, etc. This can drive innovation, or simply reveal better ways of doing something. Reframing a problem does not solve the original problem, it just extends the problem into something else as well.

Don't treat interviews like a normal social interaction as they are distinctly not. When being social you might strive to talk ~50% of the time. This is not the case at all for interviews.

# Chapter 2

Leave your world view at the door. Do not bring your own beliefs, values and whatnot to an interview. Stay neutral and make the interview about the interview, not you.

Ask questions to which you think you already know the answer to. The response you get from customers might surprise you.

Be selective about when to reveal information about yourself. It can in some cases be helpful to build rapport, but more often than not it can skew an interview.

During an interview, you'll often go from question-answer, question-answer to **question-story**. This is where you want to end up and this is where the best insights lie.

Act as if... Be aware of your body language when you are conducting an interview. Position yourself in a way where it's obvious that you are listening. This might in turn actually make you listen more as the concept of "act as if" actually works.

# Chapter 3

Be conscious about who you recruit and why. Don't fall for just recruiting people in the office, or worse, family. If you are having trouble recruiting people that match your criteria, it might reveal something interesting as well. Thus, make criteria first, then recruit.

First figure out what you want to have answered, then figure out what questions you are going to ask to get answers to those questions.

Interview flow should be roughly
- Introduction
- Main body
- Projection / dreams
- Wrap up

Make sure to assign durations to each section that will help guide you through the process and to ensure that you get through everything you intend to.

One of the most important things to establish during the introduction is that there are no wrong answers and no hurt feelings for what you might say.

For the main body, split it into sections for what you want to explore. Be deliberate in how you structure these sections. No rule here, but give it some thought so that it makes sense in an interview setting.

During the projection section you should ask questions that are more audacious, such as "what would your ideal experience of this be?". You've now established a rapport and you are likely to get good answers.

Wrap up by asking whether you missed something or open the room for other questions.

> Take photos of desk, env. etc. It might be important for explaining why people work the way they do.

# Chapter 4

Asking direct questions to the answers you want can be beneficial, e.g. "how do you give someone access to the system?". However, what this reveals is more likely to be the answer to the question "How do you feel about the process of giving someone access to the system", or "can you recall all the steps necessary to give someone access to the system?". This is valuable as well, but might not be the answer you were hoping for.

Instead "show me how you give someone access to the system" is a better question if you are actually wanting to see how the user does this. Even better, make the participant the teacher by asking "Can you show me how I would add a user to the system". This reinforces that they are the expert, establishing a better report.

When showing prototypes or concepts you've been working on, present them to the client in the most objective way as possible. Don't say something like "Here's something I've been working on for the past weeks". This potentially influences the responses you are going to get. Instead say something as simple as "what do you think of this?", or "we're exploring many different ideas as the moment, what do you think of this one?".

Resist answering questions you get in response to showing concepts. When a client asks whether you actually have to give a user a role in the system before they can actually do anything, don't answer, instead ask why that's important to them, or "what would you expect?".

# Chapter 5

Ideal size for the field team conducting the interview is 2 people, one to lead the interview and one to back up the other person. The leader runs the interview and coordinates the participation of the backup. Even if you are a backup, you still need to be engaged, but do not interject or interrupt the lead. Write down and hold your questions for the appropriate time.

Avoid assigning specific roles to people in the interview. You are both interviewers and should both be doing all the things. Instead of saying that someone is the note-taker and another person is the photographer, assign tasks some 30 minutes before the interview.

An interview usually goes through 7 distinct stages

- **Getting There**: You get there introduce yourself, set up your equipment and get ready to conduct the interview. It's important at this stage not to start the interview right away, and small-talk only about random topics not related to the interview.
- **Restate Objectives**: State why you have come and what you are doing. It's important that expectations are set. Introduce yourself at this stage.
- Kick-Off Question: Start broad, maybe asking something that's not even related to the interview like "Maybe introduce yourself and tell us what your job is here".
- **Accept the Awkwardness**: Interviewing can be a little awkward, both for you and the participant. Establish rapport at this stage and make the person you're interviewing feel comfortable. This is important to reach
- **The Tipping Point**: When conversation revolves around stories and not just answers to questions. This is where the most valuable insight lies.
- **Reflection and Projection**: Keep in mind that the future they predict is quite possible not the correct one. People cannot predict the future.
- **The Soft Close**: Keep in mind the "doorknob phenomenon" where the most valuable insights might come as you are about to leave. Keep recording devices on until you have actually left.

Silence is fine. Ask your question
