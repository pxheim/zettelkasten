# Chapter 1

You are not your user. Do not get caught up in designing something the way you want it. You have to design it the way your users would want it in order to truly design something that people will want vs. just enthusiasts. Similarly, don't get caught up in the way you want things to be when conduction research. Stay neutral.

When interviewing users, they are not magically going to give you all their needs that you can then go ahead and implement. It's a longer process where insights need to be filtered out from other potential noise coming from the customer.

> Don't design for yourself, but don't design just for the customer either.

Some pain points are not painful enough. People's tolerance to "good enough" solutions is referred to as "satisficing", coined by Herbert Simon. You might find that there are many things you or your customer want to have, but the pain of not having it is not great enough to really matter.

Talking to customers can also help reframe your perspective on what you are trying to achieve, e.g. seeing it from another perspective, turning it on its head, etc. This can drive innovation, or simply reveal better ways of doing something. Reframing a problem does not solve the original problem, it just extends the problem into something else as well.

Don't treat interviews like a normal social interaction as they are distinctly not. When being social you might strive to talk ~50% of the time. This is not the case at all for interviews.

# Chapter 2

Leave your world view at the door. Do not bring your own beliefs, values and whatnot to an interview. Stay neutral and make the interview about the interview, not you.

Ask questions to which you think you already know the answer to. The response you get from customers might surprise you.

Be selective about when to reveal information about yourself. It can in some cases be helpful to build rapport, but more often than not it can skew an interview.

During an interview, you'll often go from question-answer, question-answer to **question-story**. This is where you want to end up and this is where the best insights lie.
