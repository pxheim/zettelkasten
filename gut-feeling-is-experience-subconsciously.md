Gut feeling is the root of most decisions when it comes to coding and architecture. However, gut feeling is not "random". Your gut feeling is the years of experience telling you subconsciously what's the right path to take.

Junior developers act on gut feeling as well, but it's just not as developed as senior devs.

Thus, your gut feeling should probably get more credit than it does, and relying on it should not make you feel bad.
