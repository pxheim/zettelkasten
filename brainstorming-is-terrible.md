Brainstorming is an activity that helps you get everything from your head onto a piece of paper. This is what Zettelkasten already does for you if you use it correctly. Then, instead of brainstorming, you already have everything in front of you in your Zettelkasten and you can begin producing right away instead of trying to remember things from your brain. It shifts the focus to thinking, away from remembering.
