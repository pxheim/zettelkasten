A simple design is a design where the concern of high level policies are decoupled from low level details. Similarly, abstraction is the amplification of the essential, and elimination of the irrelevant. An example of this would be a method call that just calls other methods that deal with the details of what you want to do. You would then clearly be able to read what's going on by looking at the main method, without worrying about complex if statements, switches, etc.

There are 4 "rules" of simple design. Code should be:

- Covered by tests (sometimes passes tests)
- Reveal the intention
- No duplication
- Fewest elements (small)

Simple design is one of the core elements of [[software-craftsmanship]].
