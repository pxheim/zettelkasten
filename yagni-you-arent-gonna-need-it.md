YAGNI, you aren't gonna need it is a principle from XP that means: if something can be left out of your code, you should probably do so. If you do not need it now, you're probably not going to need it in the future. Always ask yourself this, and consider whether you actually need the stuff you are adding.

Ties into the V part of the [[invest-principle-for-user-stories]]. If you do not need something now, it's probably won't create any value now either, and thus it should not be included in a story.
