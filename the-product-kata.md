A methodology that can be used to discover the right products to build. It follows the principles of a martial arts kata where you have 4 steps to iterate over in order to create products that provide value to your customers.

1. Understand the direction. Figure out the vision and goals of the product you're making.
2. Analyze the current state. Figure out where the product is today.
3. Set the next goal.
4. Experiment towards the target.

The latter can be broken down into:

1. Current condition. What's the current condition relevant to the goal you're chasing.
2. Obstacle. What's preventing you from reaching your goal.
3. Step. What's the next step to resolve the obstacle. Most likely this will be an experiment that will help you learn more about the state of your product.
4. Expected. What's the expected outcome by performing the step towards the goal?
5. Learned. What did you actually learn from performing the experiment?

Example:

**Goal**: Sellers should be able to be self sufficient.

**Target**: Sellers call office less than twice a week.

| Sellers call office more than twice a week. | We're not sure how often they are calling now.              | Measure how often they are calling over the next week.            | They are calling about 4 times a week each.             | They call about 7 times a week.                                      |
| Sellers call office 7 times per week.       | We're not sure why they are calling.                        | Ask office staff why they are calling the most.                   | We come away with a list of top reasons why they call.  | They call for revenue, what they're selling (and see list for more). |
| Sellers call office 7 times per week.       | We're not sure which items they call about most frequently. | Have staff measure the frequency of each type of call for 1 week. | We come away knowing which items take up the most time. | They call mostly to learn revenue.                                   |
