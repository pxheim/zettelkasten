Make a big pile of _all_ the clothes you have from all rooms. Then start sorting off season clothes before other ones. Reason for this is that you haven't just worn them, nor can you, so it should be easier to discard the ones you don't want.

Don't just downgrade clothes to loungewear instead of discarding. Self image is impacted by the stuff you wear at home, so wear something nice, even when you are not doing anything important.

Don't stow away seasonal clothes. Keep all your clothes up front. You never know when you'll have a warm October. This also makes it easier to get an overview of what you actually have.
