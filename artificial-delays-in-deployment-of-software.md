Artificial delays are when the release of software is delayed when it does not have to be.

For example, completing every single feature of a program before releasing is one source. A better approach would be to deploy incrementally the smallest features first.

Another source of artificial delays are the common beta testing environments where software is uploaded to some environment where it's simply observed for some time to ensure that it does not break.



Another source of artificial delays is the notion of stabilization. Teams will frequently set aside a period of continuous testing during which they watch the system to see if it fails. If no failures are detected after X days, the developers feel safe to recommend the system for deployment.

This also goes against CI. Build should be working until proven otherwise.
