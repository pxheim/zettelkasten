Artificial delays are when the release of software is delayed when it does not have to be.

For example, completing every single feature of a program before releasing is one source. A better approach would be to deploy incrementally the smallest features first.

Another source of artificial delays are the common beta testing environments where software is uploaded to some environment where it's simply observed for some time to ensure that it does not break. If no failures are detected after some time, then the software is assumed to be working and can be released.

This goes against CI where all builds should be assumed to be working until proved otherwise. [[ci-requires-a-change-of-mindset]].
