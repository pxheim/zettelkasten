Brainstorming as part of the natural planning process can be beneficial to figure out how to get to where we want to, i.e. if you have a purpose defined, and you know the outcome, you need to brainstorm to figure out how to get there through your values.

```
         values        values
Purpose --------> ??? --------> Outcome
                   |--> Determined by brainstorming.
```

When brainstorming like this, refrain from analyzing and organizing. You're just making a list for the sole purpose of offloading your brain. [[off]]
