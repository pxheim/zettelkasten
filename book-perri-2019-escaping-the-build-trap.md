# Literature Notes

The "Build Trap" is when companies get stuck measuring output instead of outcome, i.e. focusing on "more" w/o focusing on what creates value.

Products & Services are not inherently valuable. It's what they do for the customer that creates value.

Very common to reward based on output, e.g. devs for code output, designers for making more designs, etc. And teams for shipping features.

Shift from project based focus to product based. When you're done with a project and ship it to customers, you're not done, which is why product focus is important. Alternatives:
- Sales left: typical for startups. Sales promise features that devs need to make.
- Visionary led: like Steve Jobs in Apple. Works for a short time, not sustainable.
- Tech led: always chasing the latest & greatest. Important, but does not alone drive value.

When starting a new project, list out the knowns vs unknowns.
- known, knowns: what you know to be true.
- known, unknowns: you know what questions to ask. This is the domain of the product manager.
- unknown, knowns: intuition
- unknown, unknowns: surprises.

There are several types of "bad" product managers:
- The mini CEO, thinks he's boss and wants to lead the team, not work with them.
- The waiter, lacks strategic thinking. Only implements what the customers say they want, not what they actually need.
- Former project manager, always focuses on when instead of why.

Product owner is a role you play in Scrum, whereas product manager is a career. The scope of a product manager is much greater.

Probably the most important skill other than being literate across multiple disciplines is to marry business goals w/ customer goals to create value.

Talk w/ users. Not just product manager, but bring the team too. Creates a shared understanding for what to build.

PMs job can be split into 3 categories
- tactical work, day to day work splitting features into USs, etc.
- strategic work, positioning the product or company.
- operational work, tying strategy back to tactical work that can be done.

In the start of your career you'll do a lot of tactical work, later move to more strategic and operational.

Organize your team around value streams, i.e. all activities that together create value for your customer. If you have an app, make sure not to just organize around that. It might not be what _really_ creates value for your customers. Extreme example: organize around strategic goals like retention, acquiring users, etc.

A good strategy is a framework that help you make decisions. It's not a plan!

When companies treat their strategy like a plan, they often fail due to one 3 gaps [[friction-effects-gap]], [[friction-knowledge-gap]] and [[friction-alignment-gap]]. Solving the gaps involve:
- knowledge: only request as much information you need to make a decision. Focus on strategic intent [[lead-with-intent]].
- alignment: allow each level in the company to decide how to solve the why. Agency.
- effects: let the teams themselves figure out the actions needed to solve the why. Autonomy.

Don't be confused by vanity metrics when looking at product metrics. These are things like "how many users do we have" or "how many page views do we get". They will always get higher and make you look impressive. Adding a time component to a vanity metric makes it actionable, e.g. additional users this month. Also output metrics are bad, e.g. how many story points did we complete, etc.

Lagging metrics are hard to measure because you need data for some time before you can measure it. Retention is a lagging metric. Find leading metrics to measure, e.g. happiness and satisfaction are metrics leading to retention.

The best way to understand the problem your software might have is to talk to customers and ask them.

"Nobody wants to hear that their baby is ugly", but sometimes it's best to kill of bad ideas fast. Focus on the problem not the fads.

Experimentation is all about building to learn, not building to earn. Experiment before building the real solution:
- Concierge, experiment where you do everything for the customer and they know it. You provide a service to see whether it's a good one or not.
- Wizard of Oz, same as concierge, but the customer does not know.
- Concept, show something to the user to see how they react. Video, landing page, etc.

Best way to prioritize work is cost / delay. Basically you evaluate value vs urgency.

Definition of done most often does not take into account measuring a featu
