[[accidental-and-deliberate-coupling]]

There are two ways coupling can manifest itself in software, deliberate and accidental. The first is coupling you need. Just like a watch will not be able to function without the components interacting with one another, software will not either. Accidental coupling, however, is coupling that you wish to avoid. This leads to complex systems. 

# Literature Notes

Coupling is unavoidable if you want your system to have a purpose. It's the interplay between components that create purpose, e.g. a clock, the components need to interact for it to work. Coupling is not synonymous w/ bad design. Sometimes you need it, but it should be deliberate.

Accidental and deliberate (essential) coupling, we want to avoid the first, and we need the latter for the system to work.

Good examples on the Cynefin framework

**In the complex domain, you need to perform experiments to uncover the unknowns until you eventually find yourself in the complicated domain.**
