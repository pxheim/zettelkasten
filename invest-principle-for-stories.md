INVEST is an acronym to help write good user stories. A story should follow all the guides highlighted by the acronym or be reworded or rewritten.

- **Independent**. It should not depend on any other user stories, not should it overlap any other story in concept.
- **Negotiable**. It should not be set in stone. It can change over the course of development, either by customer or developer.
- **Valuable**. The story should provide value to the customer. If splitting up the story into smaller parts, each part should still provide some value.
- **Estimable**. You should, to a certain degree, be able to estimate how long the user story will take.
- **Small**. It should fit within one iteration (sprint).
- **Testable**. You should be able to write tests for it once implemented.
