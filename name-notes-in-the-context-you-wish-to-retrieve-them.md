Consider not only what the note says when naming it or adding tags, keywords, etc to it. Consider what context you wish to retrieve your note in in the future. This is the name you should give to the note. Not only what it means in isolation, but what it can mean in other context as well.

A good example of this is how [[allen-2022-getting-things-done]] talks about sorting your next actions lists based on the context you're currently in. A list of "things to do for the house" can contain a next-action like "buy paint". This is not that great as you you're likely to check that list when you're at the house. Instead a list of "errands" would be better as you're likely to check that list when you're in the context of running errands, e.g. on your way to the store.
