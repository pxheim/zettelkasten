The bus factor refers to how many people have to be run over by a bus for the knowledge to be lost. A bus factor of 1 means if you die (or leave), the knowledge is lost. The bus factor must never be 1.

It's not the responsibility of the company to increase the bus factor. It's _your_ responsibility to make sure someone can cover for you.
