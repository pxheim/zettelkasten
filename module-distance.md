Distance is a measure of how close code is, both on a technical level, but also on a socio-technical level. On a technical level, code in the same statement is closer than code in two separate methods, which is again closer than code in separate classes, and so on. On a socio technical level, code made by the same team is closer than code made by two separate teams.

Components that are located close to each other area easier to change than those located far apart. This is a double edged sword, as close components also have to change when related ones change. We can say tat the distance is the inverse of lifecycle coupling.
