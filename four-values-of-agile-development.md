The four core values of agile development are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

It's very important that these are preferred, but do not replace, the complementary values of processes, tools, documentation, contracts, and plans.
