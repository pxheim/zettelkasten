The four core values of agile development are:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. The human aspect of development is important, and processes and tools should not hinder setting up an environment that facilitates that. Teams should focus on face-to-face conversations and have tools that support this.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation. Having extensive documentation should not get in the way of delivering iteratively.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Instead of renegotiating an initial contract, it is better to have close collaboration with the customer and adapt to changes based on rapid feedback. Developers and customers should meet regularly to ensure that communication is good and that whatever product is being made meets the needs.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

It's very important that these are preferred, but do not replace, the complementary values of processes, tools, documentation, contracts, and plans.
