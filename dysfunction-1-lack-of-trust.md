The first dysfunction is the absence of trust. Without trust people in a team cannot communicate effectively, nor are they likely to open up to their other teammates. They will be guarded and potentially fear that any vulnerability they might reveal will be used against them.

Takes time to fix, but to get started you can do the following
- Personal history exercise: each member will share some details about themselves. It does not have to be very revealing, but things like, age, where you live, hobbies, best job, worst job, etc. are good.
- Team effectiveness exercise: each member will, for each of their peers, identify the most important thing this person does for the team, as well as one thing they need to improve upon or change.
- Personality profiles: perform a personality test for each person in the team to better assess how they can work together. There are many available, but some of the more common ones are MBTI and Gallup.
- 360 degree feedback: [[$Research]]
- "Traditional" team building: While there might be some merit to this, it's not controlled enough to be able to facilitate improving trust.

As a leader, you must set an example when it comes to building trust. Be the first one to share something about yourself. Be vulnerable. And make sure to create an environment where everyone can be the same.
