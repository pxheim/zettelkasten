If you do not hold your peers accountable it will ultimately lead to low standards across the board. It's often hard to call out your peers, especially if you have a close personal relationship with them. However, by not calling people out, you it will ultimately deteriorate the relationship as you'll instead be annoyed by your peer not living up to your expectations.



Avoidance of accountability: low standards. If you don't commit, you also cannot be held accountable. After all, you didn't agree with whatever was decided anyway as you didn't get to offload your thoughts. This leads to low standards. You should hold your peers accountable, not just the people that report to you. This means, that all leaders, as peers, should hold each other accountable.
