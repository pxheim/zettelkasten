Avoidance of accountability: low standards. If you don't commit, you also cannot be held accountable. After all, you didn't agree with whatever was decided anyway as you didn't get to offload your thoughts. This leads to low standards. You should hold your peers accountable, not just the people that report to you. This means, that all leaders, as peers, should hold each other accountable.
