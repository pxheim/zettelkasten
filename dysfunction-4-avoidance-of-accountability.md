If you do not hold your peers accountable it will ultimately lead to low standards across the board. It's often hard to call out your peers, especially if you have a close personal relationship with them. However, by not calling people out, you it will ultimately deteriorate the relationship as you'll instead be annoyed by your peer not living up to your expectations.

In order to avoid:
- Publication goals: When agreeing to something, ensure that it's in the open and everyone can track progress towards it.
- Simple and regular progress reviews: Give people feedback often and compare their performance with the goals that have been set. 
- Team rewards: Shift from individual achievements towards team achievements. A team is less likely to stand by and watch themselves fail due to a single person not dragging their weight when the goal is for the whole team.
