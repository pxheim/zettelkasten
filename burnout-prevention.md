Preventing burnout requires focusing on:
1. Creating a respectful environment without blame
2. Communicating purpose
3. Supporting employee development
4. Removing blockers
5. Providing learning resources
6. Granting autonomy

Organizations should focus on fixing the environment rather than individuals, recognizing that team interactions matter more than individual capabilities.
