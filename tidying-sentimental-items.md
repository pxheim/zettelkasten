Truly precious memories will not Vanish because you discard the item that gave you the memory. If the item itself does not spark joy it can be discarded.

Don't sent sentimental items to another place like a cabin or parents' place. It's not a fourth dimension with infinite space. Deal with the items, ask yourself if they spark joy, and if they don't, discard them.

Tidying your past is good for your present self.
