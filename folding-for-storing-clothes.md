Folding beats hanging in terms of storage and care for your clothes. Don't stack like a store would. That only makes sense if you are selling multiple of the same item, not if you want to see what you have so you can decide what to wear / use. Stand them up so you can see what you have.

Don't "potato ball" your socks. They don't like it.
