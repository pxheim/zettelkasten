There are 3 types of cognitive load:
1. Intrinsic: the load experienced by the core work that you do. This is related to your basic skills, programming language, etc.
2. Extraneous: the load experienced due to the environment you work in. Instead of "making", which would be intrinsic, this is related to what you do with what you have made, e.g. deployment, configuration, etc.
3. Germane: load experienced when you process new information.

Intrinsic load can be reduced by getting better at what you do, most commonly through training. Extraneous load can be reduced by automating tasks that you do often. Together this leaves room for focusing on germane work, where value is created.
