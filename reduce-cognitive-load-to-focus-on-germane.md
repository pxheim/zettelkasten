There are 3 types of cognitive load:

1. **Intrinsic**: the load experienced by the core work that you do. This is related to your basic skills, programming language, etc. Can be reduced by getting better at what you do, most commonly through training.
2. **Extraneous**: the load experienced due to the environment you work in. Instead of "making", which would be intrinsic, this is related to what you do with what you have made, e.g. deployment, configuration, etc. Can be reduced by automating tasks that you do often
3. **Germane**: load experienced when you process new information. This is where value is created.
