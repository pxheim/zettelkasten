The 5 step process for improving cycle time is:
1. Identify the constraint.
2. Exploit the constraint, i.e. set them up for success.
3. Subordinate others, i.e. force others to help out wherever possible.
4. Elevate the constraint, i.e. hire more people, add more compute power, etc.
5. Start from 1 again.
