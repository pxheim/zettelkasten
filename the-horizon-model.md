The Horizon Model is a renaming of the system proposed by [[allen-2022-getting-things-done]] to get a sense of your priorities. It's a 6 layer system where the top layers create context for the bottom layers. It's called the horizon layer as when you're at level 0 (ground) you only consider what's right in front of you (next actions), but the further up you go the more and more of the horizon you consider.

5. purpose
4. vision
3. goals
2. areas of focus
1. projects
0. current immediate tasks.

Considering the "Horizon Model", counterintuitively, a bottom up approach is often the best. Clear the most immediate things to free your mind to think about the broader topics. If your boat is sinking, it does not matter what direction it's pointing.

The first three layers of this model are where the majority of your actions come from. Level 2 are your focus areas or areas of responsibility, either at home or at work. These create projects for Level 1, which in turn create actions for the ground level.

It is a good idea to create a checklist for Level 2 and review it often. This would typically be what your responsibilities are at work, and it's good to verify that you are doing what you're hired to do.
