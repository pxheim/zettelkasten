Considering the "Horizon Model", counterintuitively, a bottom up approach is often the best. Clear the most immediate things to free your mind to think about the broader topics. If your boat is sinking, it does not matter what direction it's pointing.

The three first layers of the "Horizon Model" are where the majority of actions come from. Level 2 are your focus areas or areas of responsibility, either at home or at work. These create projects for Level 1, which in turn create actions for the ground level. Make it a habit (or checklist) to review level 2 often.
