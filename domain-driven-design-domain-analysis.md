When architecting an application, it's often helpful to perform a domain analysis first. This looks at a company's domains and split them into business domains, which are then split into business subdomains.

The business domain is the company's overall area of activity, e.g. retail or cloud-computing. A business can have more than one, like Amazon who has both retail _and_ cloud-computing.

The business subdomains, are essentially building blocks that are required for the company to succeed. There are three types:

- Core: the core things that the company does that provide a competitive advantage. Often referred to as the "secret sauce". These are considered highly volatile and complex.
- Generic: things the company needs to do, but someone has already done it. Essentially things that are complex. but have already been solved and can be bought off the shelf. These are not volatile.
- Supporting: things that support core or generic domains. They are complicated and obvious, but are often too specific for a company to buy off the shelf. They do not provide a competitive advantage.
