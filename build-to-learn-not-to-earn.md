Before making a new feature or project, you should almost always conduct an experiment to evaluate whether you are building the right thing for your customers. The focus of this experiment should be to build something to learn what the customers need instead of how to many money.

Some types of experiments:
- Concierge: experiment where you provide a service to your customers and they know it. E.g. instead of making an office map drawing solution, you draw the office map for them.
- Wizard of Oz: the same as concierge, but the customers do not know it.
- Concept: experiment where you show the customer a video of landing page showcasing the feature or product without actually having anything made.
