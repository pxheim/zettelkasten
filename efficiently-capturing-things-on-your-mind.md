According to the GTD principles, there are three main rules for efficiently capturing things:

1. Capture everything that's on your mind. To avoid being a victim of the Zeigarnik effect where unfinished things clog your brain, get _everything_ out of your brain and into an external system.
2. Have as few capture locations ($in) as possible. These are often referred to as "in" boxes or places. Most commonly you'll have an email inbox and at least one more in-box where you'll keep track of things that pop up.
3. Keep your $in(s) clean, meaning clean them out by defining what to do with the items in your in-boxes. This is the clarify step of the GTD method.
