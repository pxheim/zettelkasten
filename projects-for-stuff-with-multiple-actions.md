Almost everything you do turn into projects, i.e. they last a while and require more than 1 next-action to complete. I'ts very important to get all projects down on paper or into software you are using. Problems you wish to solve and things you want to learn are all projects.

Projects are things that take several next-actions over a longer period of time to complete. Doing enough of the next actions will eventually complete the project. They can be things like "renovate the bedroom". These should be kept separate, but you should still define the next action for them!

Sorting projects into sub-projects can be tempting, but be cautious here. Start off simple with one project first, even if the list is long.
